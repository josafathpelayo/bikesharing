## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, a bike trip analysis was done from data gathered in a bike sharing program in the city of NYC for the month of August. Through tableau, we we're able to create a visual analysis of how effect a program can be in a busy city. ALthough Des Moines is a totally different city from New York City, our analysis provides a unique insight of how this program can be implemented. A key factor in our analysis is tripduration. Finding out how long the trips are in the month of August will provide who rides the bikes, time frames from hours to weekday trends, and as will show  how long bikes were rented.

## Results
With the use of Tableau, I was able to determine:

- There was a total of 2 [Graph#1](https://public.tableau.com/authoring/module14_16197560745520/NumberofTrips#2)

- There was 1,900,359 riders that were subscribers where as 443,865 riders were customers (Graph#2](https://public.tableau.com/authoring/module14_16197560745520/Customers#2) 

- The peak time for checkout time is no longer than 5 minutes in duration [Graph#3](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/josafath.pelayo/viz/Bike_sharing_16255519937160/Dashboard1)

### Summary
Overall, the use of bikesharing program in a metropolitian city like NYC has it's benifits and would likely transfer over to other major cities like Des Moines. The data shows that theor is a high volums of riders even if its for s short duration of time, like 5-6 minutes. Although there is sufficient data to provide to investors, additional analysis can be created. One visualiztion that can be used is to show the total distance convered by weekday or week to show the usage of the bikes. Another good visualization is to show how many times a customer didn't canceled their subscrition or how many new subscribers are added per day. This will provide a ratio of how many returning and new customers the program is retaining.
